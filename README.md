# cs-assistant
A simple desktop app with to allow for task mamagement.

Basic functions:
Add tasks.
Set task priority.
Set task status (not started, in progress, completed).
Set task duraton and track time elapsed on each task.

Set any one task as the "current" task, which is tied to a countdown timer in the app. This adds time to the time elapsed on that task while decreasing the current timer value.

When the timer value becomes zero, prompt the user to switch tasks or take a break.

Allow for breaks (pausing and resuming without changes to the current timer).
