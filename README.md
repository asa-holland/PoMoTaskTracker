# PoMo, your Personal Task Tracker

Meet PoMo! PoMo is a simple desktop app that helps you with task and time management.

Basic functions of PoMo:
Add tasks and set task priority (low, mid, high), status (not started, in progress, completed), and expected duration.

Each task also has an 'elapsed duration', which is obtained when the task is being currently worked on. 

PoMo allows you to set any one task as the "current" task, which is tied to a countdown timer in the app.
This adds time to the time elapsed on that task while decreasing the current timer value.

When the timer value becomes zero, PoMo prompts the user to switch tasks or take a break.

Breaks (pausing and resuming without changes to the current timer) occur at set times based on the length of the time of all the tasks in the current list.
